# Introduction
Here is the SSD-part of RANSOMTAG.
We utilize OpenNFM project to develop the Tag Extractor, Data Retainer, and Data Restorer models.
These models are integrated into the OpenNFM as a modified FTL of firmware.
By porting the FTL into a development board (LPC-H3131), we can achieve an SSD with RANSOMTAG enabled.
