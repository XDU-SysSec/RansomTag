   The _directio_ module is an interface to read() and write() 
         on a direct I/O context (O_DIRECT flag) from the 
         Python programming language.
   
   These system calls are Linux system calls to
          * read or write from the file ignores the buffer cache.
   
         The O_DIRECT flag introduced in SGI IRIX, where it has alignment
         restrictions similar to those of Linux 2.4. FreeBSD 4.x introduced a
         flag of the same name, but without alignment restrictions. Support was
         added under Linux in kernel version 2.4.10. Older Linux kernels simply
         ignore this flag.
         Note that on a NFS file system, the flag O_DIRECT is ignored.
