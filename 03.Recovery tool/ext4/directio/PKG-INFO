This is an interface to read() and write() on a direct I/O context (O_DIRECT flag) from the Python programming language.

These system calls are Linux system calls to
* open a file with the O_DIRECT flag, and close it.
* read or write from the file ignores the buffer cache.

The O_DIRECT flag introduced in SGI IRIX, where it has alignment restrictions similar to those of Linux 2.4. FreeBSD 4.x introduced a flag of the same name, but without alignment restrictions. Support was added under Linux in kernel version 2.4.10. Older Linux kernels simply ignore this flag.
